        Synchronous publishing mode uploads a BOM to Dependency-Track and waits for Dependency-Track to process
        and return results. The results returned are identical to the auditable findings but exclude findings that
        have previously been suppressed. Analysis decisions and vulnerability details are included in the response.

        This feature provides per-build results that display all finding details as well as interactive charts that
        display trending information.

        Synchronous mode is possible with Dependency-Track v3.3.1 and higher.
