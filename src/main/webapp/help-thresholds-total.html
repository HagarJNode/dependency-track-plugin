        Sets the threshold for the total number of critical, high, medium, or low severity findings allowed. If the
        number of findings equals or is greater than the threshold for any one of the severities, the threshold action
        will be triggered.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, if the threshold is triggered, the build will be put into an UNSTABLE state. However, a build
        can optionally be failed upon triggering a threshold.
